## Synopsis

Wikity is WordPress theme that acts as a wiki-fied bookmark manager. It can also be used as a personal wiki, one which supports forking and tracks edit history across multiple sites. It speaks Markdown, and uses a helpful card and library metaphor reminiscent of older hypertext projects.

## Motivation

Bookmark managers bookmark _pages_ when in fact what people want to save and return to are _ideas_, _theories_, _examples_, and _data_. 

Wikity breaks your bookmark manager free of the document bias. Rather than bookmark pages, you track ideas and examples you pull from them on a series of cards. These cards can be linked to one another, summarized, and even developed into full wiki pages over time. 

Importantly, in the default setup of Wikity any reader of your cards can fork them to their own library, and maintain and update them there. Wikity tracks these forking paths, and even attempts to resolve links across multiple contexts. 


## Installation

Should be installed as a theme on WordPress. Certain WordPress settings are crucial for the proper operation of Wikity. 

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.
